This is a piece of code I wrote for a friend's website between 2005
and 2007. It sat in a chat window, entertaining visitors. It is
currently in its original, uncensored form. Some language may not be
suitable for children. Some code may not be suitable for competent
programmers.

This code will never be useful again without being modified, as the
interface to the particular website is hard-coded. However, it may be
useful as a base for a persistent state conversation chatbot.
